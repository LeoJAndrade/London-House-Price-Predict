# Analysis and Prediction of House Prices in London

This project aims to analyze the **"London_Houses"** dataset, exploring patterns and factors that influence house prices in the region. An **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** was conducted to identify trends and correlations between variables such as location, number of bedrooms, and property size.

Additionally, different **machine learning models** were trained to predict house values based on their characteristics. The performance of the models was evaluated and compared using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ²**, ensuring the selection of the best approach for the problem.

In addition to physical features such as the address, neighborhood, number of rooms, and square footage, it also includes more specific details like the age of the building, garage availability, and balcony presence.
