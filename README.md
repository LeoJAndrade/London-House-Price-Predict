# Analysis and Prediction of House Prices in London

This project aims to analyze the **"London_Houses"** dataset, exploring patterns and factors that influence house prices in the region. An **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** was conducted to identify trends and correlations between variables such as location, number of bedrooms, and property size.

Additionally, different **machine learning models** were trained to predict house values based on their characteristics. The performance of the models was evaluated and compared using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ²**, ensuring the selection of the best approach for the problem.
